<h1>ðŸŒ¿ Jungle Co. â€“ Front-End Web Project</h1>

<p>Jungle Co. is a modern and visually engaging front-end web application I developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. This project is designed as an e-commerce interface for a plant and nature-themed brand, aiming to deliver an immersive and calming user experience.
</p><br>
<p>One of the key features is a full-screen video background on the homepage, which immediately draws visitors into a nature-inspired atmosphere. The site includes dedicated pages for shopping, user login, about us, and contact, each crafted with responsive design principles to ensure seamless performance across devices. Dynamic elements such as the navbar and footer are injected using JavaScript to maintain clean code and reusability.
